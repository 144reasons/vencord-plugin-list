# vencord-plugin-list

Bad script to grab Vencord Github and auto-generate a list of the built-in plugins.

## How-to

This uses 7zip, so make sure you have 7z installed. I dont know if there are differences between different linux distributions and windows, but I use `p7zip` on Arch from extra repo.
If the script fails, idk edit the sourcecode

Run `npm start`
